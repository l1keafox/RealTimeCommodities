# Installation
This project is live on GitHub pages, and the code can be viewed on the repo. No additional tools beyond a web browser are required to use this site.

* [GitHub repo here](https://github.com/l1keafox/RealTimeCommodities)

* [GitHub pages deployment here](https://l1keafox.github.io/RealTimeCommodities/)

# Usage
<!-- To be updated later with pictures since I think the news API key isn't mine? -->
Upon loading the page the user can choose from a database of commodities. Picking a commodity queries an API and fetches the last several days of data. (This is variable but for ease of use and to limit user-initiated API calls we set it to only retrieve the preceding week).

Additionally, the user's selection triggers a News API query to fetch recent articles relevant to the commodity in question.
